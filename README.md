# Forest-Fire-And-Smoke-Detection-System
In this project I am implementing several engineering methods for early detection of Forest Fire. This can dramatically reduce the  damage caused by accidental fire in forests. This detection model will use several technologies including IOT physical sensors, Image processing and Machine Learning .The purpose of using multiple technologies is to give the most optimal and earliest possible detection because the earlier we can detetct the more prevention we can provide. I will keep updating the methodology of each model ,the necessity of each individual model ,the testing results and outputs, the future plans and also the implementation issues.
